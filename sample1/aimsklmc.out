  #  Suggested "intermediate" defaults for Cs atom (to be pasted into control.in file)
  #
  #  Rb, Sr, Cs and Ba are very large atoms. This requires uncomfortably large
  #  cut_pot radii (the high cut_pot values are especially costly for hybrid DFT
  #  calculations, both regarding time and memory). Additionally, since they are
  #  relatively heavy elements, high-accuracy basis set convergence actually
  #  requires more radial functions than for their light-element counterparts.
  #
  #  Compared to the "tight" settings, the "intermediate" settings for Cs are
  #  reduced in the following way:
  #
  #  - cut_pot from 6.0 Angstrom to 5.5 Angstrom
  #
  #  The cut_pot value has a noticeable effect particularly for neutral situations
  #  (the Cs dimer is a good example) and we were not comfortable with reducing it more.
  #  ("intermediate" still implies high accuracy.) However, a comparison to the "light"
  #  settings (which are not crazy) shows that further reductions are possible in many
  #  situations, if the cut_pot value for Cs is the bottleneck. (Note that some internal
  #  cutoffs in current FHI-aims are set according to the largest atom, and so in principle,
  #  even a single Cs atom in a large structure can have a noticeable effect on memory and
  #  speed.)

  No trust radius initializer. Defaulting to   0.200000E+00 A.
  Forces evaluation will include force correction term due to incomplete self-consistency (default).
 * Notice: The s.c.f. convergence criterion sc_accuracy_rho was not provided.
 * We used to stop in this case, and ask the user to provide reasonable
 * scf convergence criteria. However, this led some users to employ criteria
 * that led to extremely long run times, e.g., for simple relaxation.
 * We now preset a default value for sc_accuracy_rho if it is not set.
 * You may still wish to check if this setting is too tight or too loose for your needs.
 * Based on n_atoms and forces and force-correction status, FHI-aims chose sc_accuracy_rho =  0.800000E-05 .
  Handling of forces: Unphysical translation and rotation will be removed from forces.

  partition_type (choice of integration weights) for integrals was not specified.
  | Using a version of the partition function of Stratmann and coworkers ('stratmann_sparse').
  | At each grid point, the set of atoms used to build the partition table is smoothly restricted to
  | only those atoms whose free-atom density would be non-zero at that grid point.

  Density update method: automatic selection selected.
  Geometry relaxation: A file "geometry.in.next_step" is written out by default after each step.
  | This file contains the geometry of the current relaxation step as well as
  | the current Hessian matrix needed to restart the relaxation algorithm.
  | If you do not want part or all of this information, use the keywords
  | "write_restart_geometry" or "hessian_to_restart_geometry" to switch the output off.
  Charge integration errors on the 3D integration grid will be compensated
  by explicit normalization and distribution of residual charges.
  Use the "compensate_multipole_errors" flag to change this behaviour.
  Set 'collect_eigenvectors' to be '.true.' for use_density_matrix .false.

  Obtaining occupation numbers and electronic chemical potential using ELSI.
  | Note that, for insulating systems, the printed 'chemical potential' value is not uniquely defined.
  | It can be anywhere in the energy gap, as long as it correctly separates occupied and unoccupied states.
  | In systems with a gap, the physically relevant chemical potential is the VBM or HOMO.

  This system has fractional occupation numbers. Thus, it is a degenerate system
  within the approximate finite broadening function (occupation_type)
  applied to determine the occupation numbers.
  This may not be harmful. However, for some systems (free atoms), a different, non-degenerate
  ground state might exist by using a smaller broadening (see keyword occupation_type).

  | Occupation number:      0.50000120

  Overall HOMO-LUMO gap:      3.39777930 eV.
  This system has fractional occupation numbers. Thus, it is a degenerate system
  within the approximate finite broadening function (occupation_type)
  applied to determine the occupation numbers.
  This may not be harmful. However, for some systems (free atoms), a different, non-degenerate
  ground state might exist by using a smaller broadening (see keyword occupation_type).

  | Chemical Potential                          :    -3.51100621 eV
  | Note that, for insulating systems, the printed 'chemical potential' value is not uniquely defined.
  | It can be anywhere in the energy gap, as long as it correctly separates occupied and unoccupied states.
  | In systems with a gap, the physically relevant chemical potential is the VBM or HOMO.

  applied to determine the occupation numbers.
  This may not be harmful. However, for some systems (free atoms), a different, non-degenerate
  ground state might exist by using a smaller broadening (see keyword occupation_type).

  Highest occupied state (VBM) at     -6.68192535 eV
  | Occupation number:      2.00000000

  Lowest unoccupied state (CBM) at    -3.64301381 eV
  | Occupation number:      0.50000525

  Overall HOMO-LUMO gap:      3.03891154 eV.
  This system has fractional occupation numbers. Thus, it is a degenerate system
  within the approximate finite broadening function (occupation_type)
  applied to determine the occupation numbers.
  This may not be harmful. However, for some systems (free atoms), a different, non-degenerate
  ground state might exist by using a smaller broadening (see keyword occupation_type).

  | Chemical Potential                          :    -3.64778311 eV
  | Note that, for insulating systems, the printed 'chemical potential' value is not uniquely defined.
  | It can be anywhere in the energy gap, as long as it correctly separates occupied and unoccupied states.
  | In systems with a gap, the physically relevant chemical potential is the VBM or HOMO.

  Highest occupied state (VBM) at     -6.83841669 eV
  | Occupation number:      2.00000000

  Lowest unoccupied state (CBM) at    -3.54570755 eV
  | Occupation number:      0.50000371

  Overall HOMO-LUMO gap:      3.29270913 eV.
  This system has fractional occupation numbers. Thus, it is a degenerate system
  within the approximate finite broadening function (occupation_type)
  applied to determine the occupation numbers.
  This may not be harmful. However, for some systems (free atoms), a different, non-degenerate
  ground state might exist by using a smaller broadening (see keyword occupation_type).

  | Chemical Potential                          :    -3.55047687 eV
  | Note that, for insulating systems, the printed 'chemical potential' value is not uniquely defined.
  | It can be anywhere in the energy gap, as long as it correctly separates occupied and unoccupied states.
  | In systems with a gap, the physically relevant chemical potential is the VBM or HOMO.

  applied to determine the occupation numbers.
  This may not be harmful. However, for some systems (free atoms), a different, non-degenerate
  ground state might exist by using a smaller broadening (see keyword occupation_type).

  Obtaining occupation numbers and electronic chemical potential using ELSI.
  | Note that, for insulating systems, the printed 'chemical potential' value is not uniquely defined.
  | It can be anywhere in the energy gap, as long as it correctly separates occupied and unoccupied states.
  | In systems with a gap, the physically relevant chemical potential is the VBM or HOMO.

  | Chemical potential (Fermi level):    -3.54521635 eV
  Highest occupied state (VBM) at     -6.84709270 eV
  | Occupation number:      2.00000000

  Lowest unoccupied state (CBM) at    -3.54044699 eV
  | Occupation number:      0.50000024

  Overall HOMO-LUMO gap:      3.30664571 eV.
  This system has fractional occupation numbers. Thus, it is a degenerate system
  within the approximate finite broadening function (occupation_type)
  applied to determine the occupation numbers.
  This may not be harmful. However, for some systems (free atoms), a different, non-degenerate
  ground state might exist by using a smaller broadening (see keyword occupation_type).

  This system has fractional occupation numbers. Thus, it is a degenerate system
  within the approximate finite broadening function (occupation_type)
  applied to determine the occupation numbers.
  This may not be harmful. However, for some systems (free atoms), a different, non-degenerate
  ground state might exist by using a smaller broadening (see keyword occupation_type).

  | Chemical Potential                          :    -3.54521635 eV
  | Note that, for insulating systems, the printed 'chemical potential' value is not uniquely defined.
  | It can be anywhere in the energy gap, as long as it correctly separates occupied and unoccupied states.
  | In systems with a gap, the physically relevant chemical potential is the VBM or HOMO.

  This system has fractional occupation numbers. Thus, it is a degenerate system
  within the approximate finite broadening function (occupation_type)
  applied to determine the occupation numbers.
  This may not be harmful. However, for some systems (free atoms), a different, non-degenerate
  ground state might exist by using a smaller broadening (see keyword occupation_type).

  Highest occupied state (VBM) at     -6.84755896 eV
  | Occupation number:      2.00000000

  Lowest unoccupied state (CBM) at    -3.54016360 eV
  | Occupation number:      0.50000006

  Overall HOMO-LUMO gap:      3.30739536 eV.
  This system has fractional occupation numbers. Thus, it is a degenerate system
  within the approximate finite broadening function (occupation_type)
  applied to determine the occupation numbers.
  This may not be harmful. However, for some systems (free atoms), a different, non-degenerate
  ground state might exist by using a smaller broadening (see keyword occupation_type).

  | Chemical Potential                          :    -3.54493296 eV
  | Note that, for insulating systems, the printed 'chemical potential' value is not uniquely defined.
  | It can be anywhere in the energy gap, as long as it correctly separates occupied and unoccupied states.
  | In systems with a gap, the physically relevant chemical potential is the VBM or HOMO.

  Final output of selected total energy values:

  The following output summarizes some interesting total energy values
  at the end of a run (AFTER all relaxation, molecular dynamics, etc.).

  | Total energy of the DFT / Hartree-Fock s.c.f. calculation      :        -661560.787937916 eV
  | Final zero-broadening corrected energy (caution - metals only) :        -661560.792431956 eV
  | For reference only, the value of 1 Hartree used in FHI-aims is :             27.211384500 eV

  Before relying on these values, please be sure to understand exactly which
  total energy value is referred to by a given number. Different objects may
  all carry the same name 'total energy'. Definitions:

  Total energy of the DFT / Hartree-Fock s.c.f. calculation:
  | Note that this energy does not include ANY quantities calculated after the
  | s.c.f. cycle, in particular not ANY RPA, MP2, etc. many-body perturbation terms.

  Final zero-broadening corrected energy:
  | For metallic systems only, a broadening of the occupation numbers at the Fermi
  | level can be extrapolated back to zero broadening by an electron-gas inspired
  | formula. For all systems that are not real metals, this value can be
  | meaningless and should be avoided.

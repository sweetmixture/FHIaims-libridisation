  #  Suggested "intermediate" defaults for Cs atom (to be pasted into control.in file)
  #
  #  Rb, Sr, Cs and Ba are very large atoms. This requires uncomfortably large
  #  cut_pot radii (the high cut_pot values are especially costly for hybrid DFT
  #  calculations, both regarding time and memory). Additionally, since they are
  #  relatively heavy elements, high-accuracy basis set convergence actually
  #  requires more radial functions than for their light-element counterparts.
  #
  #  Compared to the "tight" settings, the "intermediate" settings for Cs are
  #  reduced in the following way:
  #
  #  - cut_pot from 6.0 Angstrom to 5.5 Angstrom
  #
  #  The cut_pot value has a noticeable effect particularly for neutral situations
  #  (the Cs dimer is a good example) and we were not comfortable with reducing it more.
  #  ("intermediate" still implies high accuracy.) However, a comparison to the "light"
  #  settings (which are not crazy) shows that further reductions are possible in many
  #  situations, if the cut_pot value for Cs is the bottleneck. (Note that some internal
  #  cutoffs in current FHI-aims are set according to the largest atom, and so in principle,
  #  even a single Cs atom in a large structure can have a noticeable effect on memory and
  #  speed.)

  Target number of points in a grid batch is not set. Defaulting to  100
  Method for grid partitioning is not set. Defaulting to parallel hash+maxmin partitioning.
  Batch size limit is not set. Defaulting to    200
  By default, will store active basis functions for each batch.
  If in need of memory, prune_basis_once .false. can be used to disable this option.
  communication_type for Hartree potential was not specified.
  Defaulting to calc_hartree .
  Pulay mixer: Number of initial linear mixing iterations not set.
  Defaulting to    0 iterations.
  Work space size for distributed Hartree potential not set.
  Defaulting to   0.200000E+03 MB.
  Algorithm-dependent basis array size parameters:
  | n_max_pulay                         :        8
  Presetting      1001 iterations before the initial mixing cycle
  is restarted anyway using the sc_init_iter criterion / keyword.
  Presetting a factor      1.000 between actual scf density residual
  and density convergence criterion sc_accuracy_rho below which sc_init_iter
  takes no effect.
  No maximum number of relaxation steps, defaulting to     1000
  Default initial Hessian is Lindh matrix (thres = 15.00) plus  0.200000E+01 eV/A^2 times unity.
  No maximum energy tolerance for TRM/BFGS moves, defaulting to   0.150000E-02
  Maximum energy tolerance by which TRM/BFGS trajectory may increase over multiple steps:   0.300000E-02
  No harmonic length scale. Defaulting to   0.250000E-01 A.
  No trust radius initializer. Defaulting to   0.200000E+00 A.
  Forces evaluation will include force correction term due to incomplete self-consistency (default).
 * Notice: The s.c.f. convergence criterion sc_accuracy_rho was not provided.
 * We used to stop in this case, and ask the user to provide reasonable
 * scf convergence criteria. However, this led some users to employ criteria
 * that led to extremely long run times, e.g., for simple relaxation.
 * We now preset a default value for sc_accuracy_rho if it is not set.
 * You may still wish to check if this setting is too tight or too loose for your needs.
 * Based on n_atoms and forces and force-correction status, FHI-aims chose sc_accuracy_rho =  0.800000E-05 .
  Handling of forces: Unphysical translation and rotation will be removed from forces.
  No accuracy limit for integral partition fn. given. Defaulting to  0.1000E-14.

  Maximum # of iterations to find E_F not set. Defaulting to  200.
  Preferred method for the eigenvalue solver ('KS_method') not specified in 'control.in'.
  Calling BLACS routine to test compilation state
  The best choice would be ELPA (via ELSI), but your version of FHI-aims is compiled without ScaLAPACK support.
  Defaulting to LAPACK (via ELSI) instead (serial solution, time will not improve with more CPUs).
  Will not use alltoall communication since running on < 1024 CPUs.
  Threshold for basis singularities not set.
  Default threshold for basis singularities:  0.1000E-04
  partition_type (choice of integration weights) for integrals was not specified.
  | Using a version of the partition function of Stratmann and coworkers ('stratmann_sparse').
  | At each grid point, the set of atoms used to build the partition table is smoothly restricted to
  | only those atoms whose free-atom density would be non-zero at that grid point.
  Partitioning for Hartree potential was not defined. Using partition_type for integrals.
  | Adjusted default value of keyword multip_moments_threshold to:       0.10000000E-11
  | This value may affect high angular momentum components of the Hartree potential in periodic systems.
  No q(lm)/r^(l+1) cutoff set for long-range Hartree potential.
  | Using default value of  0.100000E-09 .
  | Verify using the multipole_threshold keyword.
  Defaulting to new monopole extrapolation.
  Density update method: automatic selection selected.
  Geometry relaxation: A file "geometry.in.next_step" is written out by default after each step.
  | This file contains the geometry of the current relaxation step as well as
  | the current Hessian matrix needed to restart the relaxation algorithm.
  | If you do not want part or all of this information, use the keywords
  | "write_restart_geometry" or "hessian_to_restart_geometry" to switch the output off.
  Charge integration errors on the 3D integration grid will be compensated
  by explicit normalization and distribution of residual charges.
  Use the "compensate_multipole_errors" flag to change this behaviour.
  Set 'collect_eigenvectors' to be '.true.' for all serial calculations. This is mandatory.
  Set 'collect_eigenvectors' to be '.true.' for use_density_matrix .false.
  Set 'collect_eigenvectors' to be '.true.' for KS_method lapack_fast and serial.

  Consistency checks for the contents of geometry.in are next.

  Number of empty states per atom not set in control.in - providing a guess from actual geometry.
  | Total number of empty states used during s.c.f. cycle:       15
  If you use a very high smearing, use empty_states (per atom!) in control.in to increase this value.

  Structure-dependent array size parameters: 
  | Maximum number of distinct radial functions  :       64
  | Maximum number of basis functions            :      102

  Obtaining occupation numbers and electronic chemical potential using ELSI.
  | Note that, for insulating systems, the printed 'chemical potential' value is not uniquely defined.
  | It can be anywhere in the energy gap, as long as it correctly separates occupied and unoccupied states.
  | In systems with a gap, the physically relevant chemical potential is the VBM or HOMO.

  This system has fractional occupation numbers. Thus, it is a degenerate system
  within the approximate finite broadening function (occupation_type)
  applied to determine the occupation numbers.
  This may not be harmful. However, for some systems (free atoms), a different, non-degenerate
  ground state might exist by using a smaller broadening (see keyword occupation_type).

  Obtaining occupation numbers and electronic chemical potential using ELSI.
  | Note that, for insulating systems, the printed 'chemical potential' value is not uniquely defined.
  | It can be anywhere in the energy gap, as long as it correctly separates occupied and unoccupied states.
  | In systems with a gap, the physically relevant chemical potential is the VBM or HOMO.

  This system has fractional occupation numbers. Thus, it is a degenerate system
  within the approximate finite broadening function (occupation_type)
  applied to determine the occupation numbers.
  This may not be harmful. However, for some systems (free atoms), a different, non-degenerate
  ground state might exist by using a smaller broadening (see keyword occupation_type).

  This system has fractional occupation numbers. Thus, it is a degenerate system
  within the approximate finite broadening function (occupation_type)
  applied to determine the occupation numbers.
  This may not be harmful. However, for some systems (free atoms), a different, non-degenerate
  ground state might exist by using a smaller broadening (see keyword occupation_type).

  Obtaining occupation numbers and electronic chemical potential using ELSI.
  | Note that, for insulating systems, the printed 'chemical potential' value is not uniquely defined.
  | It can be anywhere in the energy gap, as long as it correctly separates occupied and unoccupied states.
  | In systems with a gap, the physically relevant chemical potential is the VBM or HOMO.

  | Chemical potential (Fermi level):    -3.38028948 eV

  This system has fractional occupation numbers. Thus, it is a degenerate system
  within the approximate finite broadening function (occupation_type)
  applied to determine the occupation numbers.
  This may not be harmful. However, for some systems (free atoms), a different, non-degenerate
  ground state might exist by using a smaller broadening (see keyword occupation_type).

  Obtaining occupation numbers and electronic chemical potential using ELSI.
  | Note that, for insulating systems, the printed 'chemical potential' value is not uniquely defined.
  | It can be anywhere in the energy gap, as long as it correctly separates occupied and unoccupied states.
  | In systems with a gap, the physically relevant chemical potential is the VBM or HOMO.

  | Chemical potential (Fermi level):    -3.38028369 eV
  Highest occupied state (VBM) at     -7.13062044 eV
  | Occupation number:      2.00000000

  Lowest unoccupied state (CBM) at    -3.37551433 eV
  | Occupation number:      0.50000029

  Overall HOMO-LUMO gap:      3.75510611 eV.
  This system has fractional occupation numbers. Thus, it is a degenerate system
  within the approximate finite broadening function (occupation_type)
  applied to determine the occupation numbers.
  This may not be harmful. However, for some systems (free atoms), a different, non-degenerate
  ground state might exist by using a smaller broadening (see keyword occupation_type).

  This system has fractional occupation numbers. Thus, it is a degenerate system
  within the approximate finite broadening function (occupation_type)
  applied to determine the occupation numbers.
  This may not be harmful. However, for some systems (free atoms), a different, non-degenerate
  ground state might exist by using a smaller broadening (see keyword occupation_type).

  | Chemical Potential                          :    -3.38028369 eV
  | Note that, for insulating systems, the printed 'chemical potential' value is not uniquely defined.
  | It can be anywhere in the energy gap, as long as it correctly separates occupied and unoccupied states.
  | In systems with a gap, the physically relevant chemical potential is the VBM or HOMO.

  This system has fractional occupation numbers. Thus, it is a degenerate system
  within the approximate finite broadening function (occupation_type)
  applied to determine the occupation numbers.
  This may not be harmful. However, for some systems (free atoms), a different, non-degenerate
  ground state might exist by using a smaller broadening (see keyword occupation_type).

  Highest occupied state (VBM) at     -6.54217999 eV
  | Occupation number:      2.00000000

  Lowest unoccupied state (CBM) at    -3.73381312 eV
  | Occupation number:      0.50000077

  Overall HOMO-LUMO gap:      2.80836687 eV.
  This system has fractional occupation numbers. Thus, it is a degenerate system
  within the approximate finite broadening function (occupation_type)
  applied to determine the occupation numbers.
  This may not be harmful. However, for some systems (free atoms), a different, non-degenerate
  ground state might exist by using a smaller broadening (see keyword occupation_type).

  | Chemical Potential                          :    -3.73858248 eV
  | Note that, for insulating systems, the printed 'chemical potential' value is not uniquely defined.
  | It can be anywhere in the energy gap, as long as it correctly separates occupied and unoccupied states.
  | In systems with a gap, the physically relevant chemical potential is the VBM or HOMO.

  Lowest unoccupied state (CBM) at    -3.55919362 eV
  | Occupation number:      0.50000126

  Overall HOMO-LUMO gap:      3.25709506 eV.
  This system has fractional occupation numbers. Thus, it is a degenerate system
  within the approximate finite broadening function (occupation_type)
  applied to determine the occupation numbers.
  This may not be harmful. However, for some systems (free atoms), a different, non-degenerate
  ground state might exist by using a smaller broadening (see keyword occupation_type).

  | Chemical Potential                          :    -3.56396296 eV
  | Note that, for insulating systems, the printed 'chemical potential' value is not uniquely defined.
  | It can be anywhere in the energy gap, as long as it correctly separates occupied and unoccupied states.
  | In systems with a gap, the physically relevant chemical potential is the VBM or HOMO.

  Highest occupied state (VBM) at     -6.84056685 eV
  | Occupation number:      2.00000000

  Lowest unoccupied state (CBM) at    -3.54440613 eV
  | Occupation number:      0.50000049

  Overall HOMO-LUMO gap:      3.29616072 eV.
  This system has fractional occupation numbers. Thus, it is a degenerate system
  within the approximate finite broadening function (occupation_type)
  applied to determine the occupation numbers.
  This may not be harmful. However, for some systems (free atoms), a different, non-degenerate
  ground state might exist by using a smaller broadening (see keyword occupation_type).

  | Chemical Potential                          :    -3.54917549 eV
  | Note that, for insulating systems, the printed 'chemical potential' value is not uniquely defined.
  | It can be anywhere in the energy gap, as long as it correctly separates occupied and unoccupied states.
  | In systems with a gap, the physically relevant chemical potential is the VBM or HOMO.

  Obtaining occupation numbers and electronic chemical potential using ELSI.
  | Note that, for insulating systems, the printed 'chemical potential' value is not uniquely defined.
  | It can be anywhere in the energy gap, as long as it correctly separates occupied and unoccupied states.
  | In systems with a gap, the physically relevant chemical potential is the VBM or HOMO.

  | Chemical potential (Fermi level):    -3.54481329 eV
  Highest occupied state (VBM) at     -6.84775770 eV
  | Occupation number:      2.00000000

  Lowest unoccupied state (CBM) at    -3.54004394 eV
  | Occupation number:      0.50000141

  Overall HOMO-LUMO gap:      3.30771376 eV.
  This system has fractional occupation numbers. Thus, it is a degenerate system
  within the approximate finite broadening function (occupation_type)
  applied to determine the occupation numbers.
  This may not be harmful. However, for some systems (free atoms), a different, non-degenerate
  ground state might exist by using a smaller broadening (see keyword occupation_type).

  This system has fractional occupation numbers. Thus, it is a degenerate system
  within the approximate finite broadening function (occupation_type)
  applied to determine the occupation numbers.
  This may not be harmful. However, for some systems (free atoms), a different, non-degenerate
  ground state might exist by using a smaller broadening (see keyword occupation_type).

  | Chemical Potential                          :    -3.54481329 eV
  | Note that, for insulating systems, the printed 'chemical potential' value is not uniquely defined.
  | It can be anywhere in the energy gap, as long as it correctly separates occupied and unoccupied states.
  | In systems with a gap, the physically relevant chemical potential is the VBM or HOMO.

  Final output of selected total energy values:

  The following output summarizes some interesting total energy values
  at the end of a run (AFTER all relaxation, molecular dynamics, etc.).

  | Total energy of the DFT / Hartree-Fock s.c.f. calculation      :        -661560.787937972 eV
  | Final zero-broadening corrected energy (caution - metals only) :        -661560.792432011 eV
  | For reference only, the value of 1 Hartree used in FHI-aims is :             27.211384500 eV

  Before relying on these values, please be sure to understand exactly which
  total energy value is referred to by a given number. Different objects may
  all carry the same name 'total energy'. Definitions:

  Total energy of the DFT / Hartree-Fock s.c.f. calculation:
  | Note that this energy does not include ANY quantities calculated after the
  | s.c.f. cycle, in particular not ANY RPA, MP2, etc. many-body perturbation terms.

  Final zero-broadening corrected energy:
  | For metallic systems only, a broadening of the occupation numbers at the Fermi
  | level can be extrapolated back to zero broadening by an electron-gas inspired
  | formula. For all systems that are not real metals, this value can be
  | meaningless and should be avoided.

  Of course, there are many other important community references, e.g., those cited in the
  above references. Our list is limited to references that describe implementations in the
  FHI-aims code. The reason is purely practical (length of this list) - please credit others as well.

          Partial memory accounting:
          | Residual value for overall tracked memory usage across tasks:     0.000000 MB (should be 0.000000 MB)
          | Peak values for overall tracked memory usage:
          |   Minimum:        1.523 MB (on task 101 after allocating d_wave)
          |   Maximum:        2.390 MB (on task  27 after allocating d_wave)
          |   Average:        2.204 MB
          | Largest tracked array allocation:
          |   Minimum:        0.396 MB (hessian_basis_wave on task 101)
          |   Maximum:        0.645 MB (hessian_basis_wave on task  27)
          |   Average:        0.594 MB
          Note:  These values currently only include a subset of arrays which are explicitly tracked.
          The "true" memory usage will be greater.

          Have a nice day.
